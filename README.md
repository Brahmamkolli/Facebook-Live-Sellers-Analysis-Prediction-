# Facebook Live Sellers Analysis & Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores and builds a machine learning classification model using Facebook Live Sellers data. The dataset includes metrics such as reactions, comments, shares, and other engagement indicators. The project covers data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset file used is `Live_20210128.csv`. Please place it in the same directory as the notebook before running the analysis.

## ðŸ“¦ Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ” Data cleaning and handling missing values  
âœ” Handling skewed numeric data  
âœ” Feature extraction from timestamps  
âœ” Visualizations for insights  
âœ” Model building and evaluation using Random Forest  
âœ” Model saving for reuse

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Classification report and confusion matrix are generated to evaluate model performance.
- Visualizations help understand distributions and trends over time.

## âš™ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Place `Live_20210128.csv` in the same folder as the notebook
3. Open `facebook_live_sellers_cleaned.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the cells step-by-step
5. The trained model will be saved as `DBSCAN model saved as dbscan_model.pkl`

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `facebook_live_sellers_cleaned.ipynb`: The cleaned and structured notebook  
- `Live_20210128.csv`: Dataset file  
- `DBSCAN model saved as dbscan_model.pkl`: Trained model file (generated after running the notebook)
